# Keyboard-Hero
SFML Game. Keyboard Trainer

Hello! Welcome to a universe full of letters, portals and ... a little evil :)
"Keyboard Hero" is an educational game that will improve your 10-finger typing skills.
Also, you need to be extremely careful during the game, because not all symbols are on your side.
For example, the characters "trolls" in a white shell, which change letters at the most inopportune moment,
or symbols "parasites" in a gray shell, which, as evil, nullify the combo
and empty the stored energy to activate bonus abilities.
